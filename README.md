# gif-buttons

There will be a series of buttons displayed at the top of the screen. 

When the buttons are clicked a series of still gifs appear on the screen in the catagory of the button name.

There is a input bar that allows users to generate new buttons that work the same way that the others do.

When a user submits a new button the currently displayed gifs will clear.

When a new button is clicked the gifs form the previous button click dissapear leaving room for the new gifs.

If the page is refreshed the custom  buttons made by the user will be gone. Leaving only the default buttons.
